# Gadgeties

   Gadgeties is an application built with robust technologies like Node.js and React.js. I built this project for fun and to enhance my programming skills. Some major functionalities include, sorting based on different gadgets attributes, filtering based on categories, pagination, authentication, and authorization. The frontend of the application consumes RESTful API’s built with Express.js and MongoDB.
